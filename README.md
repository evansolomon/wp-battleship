# WP Battleship

A little game of "Battleship" built on the WordPress Heartbeat API.

### What does it do?

It lets you check who else is currently using the WordPress admin, then forcibly log them out.

### Why?

Why not?

### Should I install it?

No, probably not.

### Let's say I did want to install it, how does it work?

When you're in the WordPress admin, you can use the Konami code to trigger a pop up that will tell you who else has used the admin in the last 5 seconds. Type in anyone's username and that person will get a message that their battleship has been sunk, then be immediately logged out.

### Is there any way to stop someone from logging me out?

Kind of, but not very easily.

### That sounds dangerous and useless

There's no need to be mean about it, okay?
